# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

I will keep some pull requests open if I'm not sure whether those libraries are
awesome. You can [vote for them](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/awesome-qr-code/pulls) by reacting with :+1:. Pull requests will be merged when their vote reaches **5**.

## Guidelines

* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
* Add the link: `* [project-name](https://example.com) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise.
    * If it is a library please add a subset of the tags `RW` after the
      projects name (inside the link text) to indicate
      whether the library can read (`R`) or generate (`W`) QR codes.
    * Please use `https` links when possible.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Don't mention `QR code` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Run `npm lint` to make sure everything is OK (this requires to run `npm
  install` once).
